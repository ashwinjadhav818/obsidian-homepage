- **Obsidian activity** 
- **Countdown** (Thanks to [@cumany](https://github.com/cumany))

## Infoboxes setup (The tables with the banner)
1. Download the CSS Snippets from ITS Theme. 
  - Link : https://github.com/SlRvb/Obsidian--ITS-Theme/blob/main/Snippets/S%20-%20Callouts.css
  - Or download directly from here.
2. Read the callouts guide : https://github.com/SlRvb/Obsidian--ITS-Theme/blob/main/Guide/Callouts.md 
  - Then, copy and paste the homepage.md and change it to your liking.
3. If you want the images to be symmetrical and want to add pages or tables to the left or right like I did, just use the "[!multi-column]" function that is already included in ITS Callouts!


## Automatic humanized greeting heading
1. I've already created a post about it on the obsidian forum : https://forum.obsidian.md/t/dataviewjs-get-an-automatic-humanized-morning-afternoon-evening-great-for-user-greetings/33351?u=farouk
2. All you need is the Dataview plugin. Go to its settings and activate dataviewjs. Copy and paste the code and change the texts as you like. 

## Life Progress
1. install Dataview plugin. Go to its settings and activate dataviewjs.
With "00. Life Progress.md", copy and paste the code and all you have to do is change the year, month and day corresponding to your birth date.
Here :

For example, if I was born on 10/20/2000, I would write
`year:` 2000,
`month:` 10,
`day:` 20

2. And then the progress bar will be set automatically with a percentage difference of your age at the age of 80. You can change to any age by changing the "80" in the line of code you see in the image above.
3. Your date of birth is for the "Life" line. The rest is already in the code.

## Obsidian activity
- With "00. Activity.md", copy and paste the code and you are done.

## Countdown
- With "00. Countdown.md", copy and paste the code and add/delete as you like. I recommend using the Blue Topaz theme if you want to have a sticker style.

Termin√©.
